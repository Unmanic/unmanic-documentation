---

Event monitoring provides a real-time alternative to periodic library scanning.
Instead of scanning your entire library at intervals, Unmanic can monitor file system events and respond immediately when files are created or modified.

## How Event Monitoring Works

When enabled, Unmanic uses file system event notifications (such as inotify on Linux) to detect when files are added or changed within your library paths.
This allows Unmanic to react instantly to new files without waiting for a scheduled scan.

## Enabling Event Monitoring

Event monitoring is configured per-library in Unmanic's settings.
Navigate to the library configuration and enable the file monitor option to start receiving real-time file events.

## Considerations and Limitations

### File System Compatibility

Event monitoring is not compatible with all file systems.
Network file systems (NFS, CIFS/SMB) and certain remote mounts may not properly support file system event notifications.
If you are using a network share, you may need to rely on [library scanning](/docs/configuration/libraries/library_scanner) instead.

### Handling Partial Files

When files are being written to your library, the file system generates events before the file is fully written.
This can cause Unmanic to attempt processing an incomplete file, particularly when files are being copied back from the cache after processing.

To avoid this issue, use the **Limit File Search by file extension** plugin in your library's plugin flow.
This plugin helps filter events to only trigger on files with specific extensions, avoiding processing of temporary or partial files during copy operations.

### Resource Usage

Event monitoring maintains a constant watch on your library directories.
For very large libraries with many subdirectories, this may consume additional system resources compared to periodic scanning.

:::note
Large libraries may cause errors with file monitoring.
If you have a large number of files on disk, search the internet for ["configuring Linux max_user_watches"](https://www.google.com/search?q=configuring+Linux+max_user_watches) to increase system limits.

:::caution
The file monitor will increase the RAM requirements of Unmanic and may not be a good option for devices with limited RAM availability.

## When to Use Event Monitoring

Event monitoring is ideal when:

- You need immediate processing of new files
- Your library is stored on a local file system with proper event support
- You have configured appropriate plugins to handle partial file scenarios

For libraries on network shares or when you prefer predictable, scheduled processing, consider using [library scanning](/docs/configuration/libraries/library_scanner) or [API-based file submission](/docs/using_unmanic/apis) instead.

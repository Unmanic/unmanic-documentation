## Requirements

This requires a recent macOS, Python 3.7-3.8, FFmpeg, and pip.

:::note
macOS Monterey 12.3 was used when creating this guide. Slight changes may need to be made for older systems.
:::

### 1) Checking requirements

First, open a Terminal window. Either click on the Spotlight search in the upper right of the screen and type Terminal, or run it from the Applications/Utilities folder.

Once the terminal is open, type:

```bash
python3 --version
```

If this is the first time running Python, it may prompt you to download the command line developer tools. Click Install to continue.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require("/img/macos-python3.png").default} />

If you already have Python installed, the version needs to be between 3.7 and 3.8 to work best with Unmanic.

### 2) Installing pip

pip is not included in macOS, so you must install it.

Open the Terminal app and enter:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/;curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```

You may see a prompt asking if Terminal can access your Desktop directory. Click Yes if prompted.

This changes directories to your Desktop folder and downloads the get-pip.py script.

Next, run the script from the Terminal:

```bash
python3 get-pip.py
```

After it downloads and installs, verify pip is installed by typing:

```bash
pip3 --version
```

### 3) Installing FFmpeg

Download FFmpeg and FFprobe from https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/.

Go to your Downloads folder and extract both FFmpeg and FFprobe. Click and drag to highlight both FFmpeg and FFprobe, then right click on them and click Copy from the menu.

Next, go to the Go menu and select Go to Folder. Enter:

```bash
/usr/local/bin
```

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-go-to-folder.png").default}
/>

When the directory opens, right click and select Paste 2 items. You will be prompted for your password. Enter it and press enter.

Next, set these files to be executable. From the terminal, enter the following:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ffprobe
```

Next, deal with the macOS security settings for unsigned packages. From the terminal, type:

```bash
ffmpeg
```

You will see a dialog similar to <img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/macos-cannot-be-opened.png').default} />. Click Cancel in the dialog box.

Open the Apple Menu -> System Preferences, open Security & Privacy, and click the Allow Anyway button.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-cannot-be-opened.png").default}
/>

From the terminal, type:

```bash
ffmpeg
```

When the dialog opens, click the Open button.

Next, repeat the same process for FFprobe. From the terminal, type:

```bash
ffprobe
```

Click Cancel in the dialog box.

Open the Apple Menu -> System Preferences, open Security & Privacy, and click the Allow Anyway button.

From the terminal, type:

```bash
ffprobe
```

When the dialog opens, click the Open button.

### 4) Installing Unmanic

From the Terminal enter:

```bash
pip3 install unmanic
```

This installs Unmanic and dependencies.

### 5) Creating a shell script to start Unmanic

For the next step, you will need root access. At the terminal, enter the following command:

```bash
sudo su -
```

This will prompt you for your account password. Enter your password and press enter.

Next, in the terminal, enter the following command:

```bash
echo "python3 -m unmanic" >/usr/local/bin/start_unmanic.sh
```

Lastly, make the shell script executable by entering the following command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/start_unmanic.sh
```

In the Terminal, type exit to leave root access:

```bash
exit
```

### 6) Start Unmanic

From the Terminal, type:

```bash
/usr/local/bin/start_unmanic.sh
```

This will start Unmanic. This terminal must be left open or Unmanic will stop.

### 7) Mount your media

Mount the remote drive that contains your media from the Go menu -> Connect to Server.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-connect-to-server.png").default}
/>

Enter the IP address and share name and click Connect.

When you are configuring Unmanic to access your library, it will now be located under the /Volumes directory.

### 8) Configure library path

Open a web browser of your choice and go to the following URL:

```bash
localhost:8888
```

Click the 3 horizontal lines in the upper left to expand the menu. Next go to Settings.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-settings.png").default}
/>

In the settings menu, you will see your default library. Click the 3 horizontal bars to the right of the library to open the configuration.

Next, click on the box that says Library Path.

By default, Unmanic looks for a library at /library, but that is in use already in macOS.

Click the .. at the top of the window to go up a level.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-up-a-level.png").default}
/>

Navigate to the /Volumes directory and you should see the network drive that was mounted in the previous step.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-select-library.png").default}
/>

From there, navigate to your media.

### 9) Optional autostart

If you would like Unmanic to start automatically, you can compile an AppleScript applet to do this.

Open Applications -> Utilities -> Script Editor.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-script-editor.png").default}
/>

Paste the following into the Script Editor:

```applescript
try
	do shell script "/usr/local/bin/start_unmanic.sh"
on error errMsg
	display dialog "ERROR: " & errMsg
end try
```

Next, go to File -> Export.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-export-script.png").default}
/>

```
Export As: Start_Unmanic
Where: Applications
File Format: Application
```

Click the Save button.

Close Script Editor. Click the Apple Menu -> System Preferences, click Users & Groups, click your username on the left, and then click the Login Items tab.

Click the + and navigate to the Applications directory and click the Start_Unmanic application.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/macos-export-script.png").default}
/>

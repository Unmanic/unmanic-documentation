## Overview

The Windows installer is provided by the [Unmanic Desktop Launcher](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-desktop-launcher) project released under GPLv3 and bundles Unmanic, Python, and ffmpeg into a single installer with a tray icon for basic controls.

:::note
If you prefer a better supported setup and are comfortable with WSL, terminal commands, Docker, and hardware passthrough, follow the [Windows 10/11 (WSL + Docker) installation guide](/docs/installation/windows_wsl) instead.

## Install

1. Download the latest Windows release from https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-desktop-launcher/releases.
2. Run the installer `.exe` and finish the setup.
3. Launch Unmanic from the Start menu to open the tray icon.

## First run updates

The first time you run the launcher, Unmanic will need to download the latest application files.

1. Open the tray menu and choose the update option.
2. Select the Stable or Beta channel.
3. Wait for the update to complete, then start Unmanic from the tray menu.

Once Unmanic is running, open http://localhost:8888 in your browser to access the web UI.

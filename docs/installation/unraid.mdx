## Instructions:

  1. Navigate to the **Apps** tab and search for "Unmanic" in the search box.
  2. Click on the "Install" button

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-install-ca1.png').default} />

  3. Modify the container variables as desired:

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-unmanic-template-volumes.png').default} />

Here are a few common variables to consider:

- Cache Directory: This is the temporary workspace where Unmanic copies files while processing. Each worker can create up to two full-size copies (input + output), so size accordingly. For example, if you process ~10 GB files with 3 workers, you should plan for up to ~60 GB of cache (10 GB x 2 x 3). If the cache directory runs out of space, jobs will fail. Use a fast disk or a dedicated share with enough headroom for your worker count and typical file sizes.
- Library mounts: Add as many library mounts as you need, remove the defaults, or create new ones. Unmanic libraries can point at any container path you define, so choose the layout that matches your shares. Ensure the paths are readable and writable by the container user (PUID/PGID) or Unmanic will not be able to scan or write output files.

:::tip
### Configuring RAM as the *Cache Directory*.
There are two main options:

#### 1) Use /dev/shm/
The simplest way to set the *Cache Directory* to a ramdisk is to set this path as `/dev/shm/unmanic`.
This path is a tmpfs mount, however it is limited to 50% of your total system memory by default.

----
#### 2) Create a custom tmpfs mount
If you wish to use more than 50% of your memory, set your *Cache Directory* to `/tmp/unmanic_tmpfs` 

Then, add the following snippet to your *Extra Parameters* and change *20g* to the upper limit of whatever amount of RAM you wish to use:
```
--mount type=tmpfs,destination=/tmp/unmanic_tmpfs,tmpfs-size=20g,tmpfs-mode=1777
```

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/ramcache-tmpfs-doc.png').default} />

This does not reserve this amount of RAM for the container. It only creates a mount limited to the amount specified.
You will still be limited to the amount of RAM available on the system as shared by all other processes.

----
Whatever option above that you choose, you will need ensure you have enough available memory for the container to use this location as the cache.

  7. Scroll to the bottom and click the "APPLY" button
 

Once the image is downloaded you should see it appear in the **Docker** tab.


## Some optional configuration steps:

### Nvidia GPU hardware encoding:

To use your NVIDIA GPU for hardware encoding in this container, follow these steps:

  1. Install the [Unraid Nvidia-Driver Plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/98978-plugin-nvidia-driver/) from the **Apps** tab.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-nvidia-plugin.png').default} />

  2. Go to the **Settings** tab, then under **User Utilities** open the **Nvidia Driver** plugin.
  3. Select the driver for your card, install it, and reboot the server.
  4. Go to the **Docker** tab, click **Unmanic**, and select **Edit** to open the container template.
  5. Toggle this Docker Container template editor to "Advanced View".
  6. In the "Extra Parameters" field, add `--runtime=nvidia`.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-unmanic-template-nvidia-extra-params.png').default} />

  7. Expand the template "Show more settings..." section near the bottom.
  8. In the "NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES" variable, copy your GPU UUID (can be found in the Unraid Nvidia Plugin. See that forum thread for details)

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-unmanic-template-nvidia-gpu.png').default} />

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to use the **h264_nvenc** and **hvec_nvenc** encoders or use the AI upscaling plugin.

### Intel hardware encoding:

To use your INTEL Processor for hardware encoding in this container, follow these steps:

  1. Install the [Intel-GPU-TOP Plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92865-support-ich777-nvidiadvb-kernel-helperbuilder-docker/).

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-intel-top-plugin.png').default} />

  2. Toggle this Docker Container template editor to "Advanced View".
  3. In the "Extra Parameters" field, add `--device=/dev/dri`.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-unmanic-template-dri-device-extra-params.png').default} />

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to use the **h264_vaapi** and **hevc_vaapi** encoders.

### AMD hardware encoding:

To use your AMD APU/GPU for hardware encoding in this container, follow these steps:

  1. Install the [Radeon-TOP Plugin](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/92865-support-ich777-nvidiadvb-kernel-helperbuilder-docker/).

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-radeon-top-plugin.png').default} />

  2. Toggle this Docker Container template editor to "Advanced View".
  3. In the "Extra Parameters" field, add `--device=/dev/dri`.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unraid-unmanic-template-dri-device-extra-params.png').default} />

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to use the **h264_vaapi** and **hevc_vaapi** encoders.

:::tip
Ryzen APU transcode performance is heavily determined by the speed of your RAM.

Setting RAM speed from 2400 to 3200 changed transcode times from around 10 minutes to around 5.

Also, if you have the option in your BIOS, set your iGPU RAM to at least 1GB (So long as you can afford to subtract that from your available RAM).

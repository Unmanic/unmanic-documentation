Get two Unmanic installations linked so one can send tasks to the other.

In this example:
- **Machine A** (`192.168.1.10`) — sends tasks to be processed elsewhere
- **Machine B** (`192.168.1.20`) — receives and processes tasks from Machine A

## Step 1: Configure local settings on both machines

**On Machine A** (`192.168.1.10`):

1. Go to **Settings → Link**
2. Set **Name** to something descriptive (e.g., "Main Server")
3. Set **Public address** to `http://192.168.1.10:8888`
4. Save

**On Machine B** (`192.168.1.20`):

1. Go to **Settings → Link**
2. Set **Name** to something descriptive (e.g., "GPU Server")
3. Set **Public address** to `http://192.168.1.20:8888`
4. Save

## Step 2: Add links on both machines

**On Machine A**, add Machine B:

1. Click the **+** button to add a link
2. Enter address: `192.168.1.20` and port: `8888`
3. Add authentication credentials if Machine B is behind a reverse proxy
4. Click **Add**

**On Machine B**, add Machine A:

1. Click the **+** button to add a link
2. Enter address: `192.168.1.10` and port: `8888`
3. Add authentication credentials if Machine A is behind a reverse proxy
4. Click **Add**

## Step 3: Configure task direction

**On Machine A** (the sender):

1. Click the configure button on the link to Machine B
2. Enable **Send tasks to this installation when workers are available**
3. Save

**On Machine B** (the receiver):

1. Click the configure button on the link to Machine A
2. Enable **Receive tasks from this installation when workers are available**
3. Save

## Step 4: Create matching libraries

On Machine B, create a library with the **same name** as a library on Machine A. Tasks are routed based on matching library names.

:::tip
Enable **Auto-configure missing libraries** in the link settings on Machine A to have libraries created automatically on Machine B when tasks are sent.
:::

## Step 5: Verify the connection

On both machines, the Unmanic icon next to the link should appear **in color** (not greyscale), indicating the other machine is reachable.

Queue a task on Machine A and watch it get sent to Machine B for processing.

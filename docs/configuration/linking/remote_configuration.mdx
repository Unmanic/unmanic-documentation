Click the configure button <img className={"inline-text-screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-configure-icon.png').default} title={"Connected Link"} /> to open
the link's configuration.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/unmanic-link-configure.png").default}
/>

A link can be configured with the following options:

## Receive tasks from this installation when workers are available

When selected, this local installation will be configured to receive tasks from the remote installations whenever local
Workers are Idle and there aren't any Pending Tasks are in the queue.

## Send tasks to this installation when workers are available

When selected, the remote installation will be configured to receive tasks from this local installation.
The same configuration option as above, but reversed.

:::note
This configuration option is disabled if the remote installation is not available.
However, if you set this option while the remote installation is available and then that installation becomes unavailable,
this option will not be disabled.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/unmanic-link-configure-send-disabled.png").default}
/>
:::

If this option is selected, you will also have the option to preload a task on the remote installation Pending Tasks queue.

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={require("/img/unmanic-link-configure-send-with-preload.png").default}
/>

When sending tasks to a remote installation, you may also configure Unmanic to preload the remote Pending Task queue
with an additional Task. This will speed up processing time as it allows the remote worker to begin carrying out jobs
on the new Task without needing to wait for the network transfer.

When preloading is enabled, you can also set the number of tasks to keep queued on the remote installation.

:::tip
Preloading uses the remote installation's _pending_ task count as a target. If the pending queue drops below your target,
Unmanic will queue extra tasks so workers do not idle while waiting for transfers. This does not cap the total work on the
remote installation (in-progress tasks are in addition), and you may briefly see the pending count go slightly above the target.
Enable preloading when network latency or large files would otherwise leave remote workers idle; leave it off if you want to
minimize queued work or conserve bandwidth.
:::

## Enable checksum validation for transfers

When enabled, Unmanic will validate checksums for files transferred to and from the remote installation to ensure file integrity.

## Auto-configure missing libraries on the remote installation

When enabled, Unmanic will import any missing library configurations to the remote installation. This only creates libraries that do not already exist on the remote installation; it does not update or sync existing library configuration after the initial import. Imported libraries are configured as remote-only with scanning disabled.

:::warning
If this option is enabled, every local library can be created on the remote installation, which effectively allows tasks from all libraries to be sent there. If you need to prevent certain libraries from ever routing tasks to a remote installation, leave this option off and create only the libraries you want on that remote.
:::

## Enable distributed worker count for this link

<img
  className={"screenshot"}
  src={
    require("/img/unmanic-link-configure-distributed-worker-count.png").default
  }
/>

Under some circumstances you may wish to link multiple installations together to share in a collective number of Workers.

This option gives you the ability to set a Worker count target to maintain across all linked installations with this
option selected.

The value selected for the Worker count target will be pushed to the remote installation.

:::note
The Worker target value is global across all installations that you select this option for. Changing it in the configuration
of one link will also change it for all others.
:::

:::note
The Worker target is a "target". Meaning that all configured installations do their best to maintain this number of Workers.
However, from time to time you may see the actually distributed Worker count increase over this or maintain below this.
This is normal. Assume this value is plus or minus one.
:::

:::tip
When wanting to maintain two libraries independently on the same PC, it is a good idea to link those installations and
configure a Worker target to share amongst those installations.

This way, you get to maintain custom plugin stacks for each library, with the benefit of limiting the overall Worker count
for that PC to whatever target you configure here.

Under the **Link** section of your Unmanic settings you will find options for linking multiple Unmanic installations.

Linking Unmanic installations is completely optional and in no way required in order to use the application, however,
it opens a range of options that further extend what Unmanic can do.

---


## Local

### Name this installation

Set a name for this installation. This will be used to identify it once linked with other installatins.

### Authentication

Set credentials for accessing the remote installation.

## Remote installations

### Adding a new Link

To add a new link, open the *Add remote installation* dialog.

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '300px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-link-add1.png').default} />

Insert the **Hostname** or **IP** as well as the **port** of the remote installation that you wish to link to.

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '300px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-link-add2.png').default} />

:::note
If your remote installation is behind a proxy adding a TLS SSL layer, be sure to add *https://* before the hostname or IP.
:::

Once you add a new link, it will be displayed immediately on both installations.

### Connection status

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '400px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-link-connected.png').default} />

When a remote installation is available, the Unmanic icon will display in colour. <img className={"inline-text-screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-link-connected-icon.png').default} title={"Connected Link"} />

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '400px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-settings-link-disconnected.png').default} />

When the remote installation is not available, the Unmanic icon will display in greyscale. <img className={"inline-text-screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-link-disconnected-icon.png').default} title={"Disconnected Link"} />

If both installations show the other remote installation icon in colour, then the link will be synchronised bi-directionally.
That is to say, modifying the configuration either of the installations will sync that configuration over to the other.

If only one installation shows the other remote installation icon in colour, then the link is synchronised one way.
This means that settings will be pushed out from only the installation that is able to see the other.

Unmanic does not require that links be configured to sync bi-directionally.
Because of this, a link may traverse more complicated network configurations such as a NAT.

### Configure remote installation Link

Click the configure button <img className={"inline-text-screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-configure-icon.png').default} title={"Connected Link"} /> to open
the link's configuration.

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '500px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-link-configure.png').default} />

A link can be configured with the following options:

#### Receive tasks from this installation when workers are available

When selected, this local installation will be configured to receive tasks from the remote installations whenever local
Workers are Idle and there aren't any Pending Tasks are in the queue.

#### Send tasks to this installation when workers are available

When selected, the remote installation will be configured to receive tasks from this local installation.
The same configuration option as above, but reversed.

:::note
This configuration option is disabled if the remote installation is not available.
However, if you set this option while the remote installation is available and then that installation becomes unavailable,
this option will not be disabled.

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '500px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-link-configure-send-disabled.png').default} />
:::

If this option is selected, you will also have the option to preload a task on the remote installation Pending Tasks queue.

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '500px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-link-configure-send-with-preload.png').default} />

When sending tasks to a remote installation, you may also configure Unmanic to preload the remote Pending Task queue
with an additional Task. This will speed up processing time as it allows the remote worker to begin carrying out jobs
on the new Task without needing to wait for the network transfer.

When preloading is enabled, you can also set the number of tasks to keep queued on the remote installation.

:::tip
Preloading uses the remote installation's *pending* task count as a target. If the pending queue drops below your target,
Unmanic will queue extra tasks so workers do not idle while waiting for transfers. This does not cap the total work on the
remote installation (in-progress tasks are in addition), and you may briefly see the pending count go slightly above the target.
Enable preloading when network latency or large files would otherwise leave remote workers idle; leave it off if you want to
minimize queued work or conserve bandwidth.
:::

#### Enable checksum validation for transfers

When enabled, Unmanic will validate checksums for files transferred to and from the remote installation to ensure file integrity.

#### Auto-configure missing libraries on the remote installation

When enabled, Unmanic will import any missing library configurations to the remote installation.
Imported libraries are configured as remote-only and with scanning disabled.


#### Enable distributed worker count for this link

<img className={"screenshot"} style={{ width: '500px' }} src={require('/img/unmanic-link-configure-distributed-worker-count.png').default} />

Under some circumstances you may wish to link multiple installations together to share in a collective number of Workers.

This option gives you the ability to set a Worker count target to maintain across all linked installations with this
option selected.

The value selected for the Worker count target will be pushed to the remote installation.

:::note
The Worker target value is global across all installations that you select this option for. Changing it in the configuration
of one link will also change it for all others.
:::

:::note
The Worker target is a "target". Meaning that all configured installations do their best to maintain this number of Workers.
However, from time to time you may see the actually distributed Worker count increase over this or maintain below this.
This is normal. Assume this value is plus or minus one.
:::

:::tip
When wanting to maintain two libraries independently on the same PC, it is a good idea to link those installations and
configure a Worker target to share amongst those installations.

This way, you get to maintain custom plugin stacks for each library, with the benefit of limiting the overall Worker count
for that PC to whatever target you configure here.

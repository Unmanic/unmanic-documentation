Unmanic is able to run a routine scan of your configured libraries to determine if files need tasks created for processing.

:::note
The scan will only run against a library if that library has the library scanner enabled.

### Options

The options for the library scanner are configured under the *Library* section in Unmanic's settings.

#### Enable periodic library scans
Select this option if you wish for Unmanic to schedule a library scanner.

#### Library scan schedule in minutes
Set the time in minutes between scans of your files in the configured library path.

#### Run a one off library scan on startup
If selected, the library scan will be executed when Unmanic starts.

#### Follow symlinks on library scans
If selected, the library scan will follow symlinks.

## Alternative Methods

Library scanning is one of several ways to discover files for processing.
Depending on your setup, you may find these alternatives more suitable:

- **[Event Monitoring](/docs/using_unmanic/event_monitoring)**: React to file system events in real-time instead of waiting for scheduled scans. Ideal for local file systems when you need immediate processing of new files.
- **[API Usage](/docs/using_unmanic/apis)**: Submit specific files for processing via scripts or external applications. Useful for large libraries where scanning would be wasteful, or when integrating Unmanic with other tools.

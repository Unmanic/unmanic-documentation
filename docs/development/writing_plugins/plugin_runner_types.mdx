## Library Management

Library Management plugins run during scans and file tests. Use them to **decide what should be processed** (queue/skip), adjust priority, or annotate reasons to ignore a file. They shape the workload **before** any heavy processing occurs and can share small snippets of context for later runners.

### File Test

#### Details:

This runner is best for adding or overriding file tests during library scans or file watch events. It allows you to decide if a file should enter the queue, adjust its priority, or append reasons why it should be skipped.

#### Executed:

After Unmanic carries out tests on a file to determine if it should be added to the task queue. Prior to returning a result of said tests.

#### Function:

`on_library_management_file_test(data)`

#### Provided data:

- **`library_id`** _[integer]_ - The ID of the library that the current task is associated with.
- **`path`** _[string]_ - String containing the full path to the file being tested.
- **`issues`** _[list]_ - List of currently found issues for not processing the file.
- **`add_file_to_pending_tasks`** _[boolean]_ - Boolean, is the file currently marked to be added to the queue for processing.
- **`priority_score`** _[integer]_ - Integer, an additional score that can be added to set the position of the new task in the task queue.
- **`shared_info`** _[dictionary]_ - Dictionary, information provided by previous plugin runners. This can be appended to for subsequent runners.

#### Example:

<details>
<summary>plugin.py</summary>

For an up-to-date example, see the [Example Plugins Repo](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/blob/examples/source/example_library_management_file_test/plugin.py)

```python
import os


def on_library_management_file_test(data):
    """
    Runner function - enables additional actions during the library management file tests.
    The 'data' object argument includes:
        library_id                      - The library that the current task is associated with
        path                            - String containing the full path to the file being tested.
        issues                          - List of currently found issues for not processing the file.
        add_file_to_pending_tasks       - Boolean, is the file currently marked to be added to the queue for processing.
        priority_score                  - Integer, an additional score that can be added to set the position of the new task in the task queue.
        shared_info                     - Dictionary, information provided by previous plugin runners. This can be appended to for subsequent runners.
    :param data:
    :return:
    """

    # Get the file extension
    file_extension = os.path.splitext(data.get('path'))[-1][1:]

    # Ensure the file's extension is lowercase
    file_extension = file_extension.lower()

    # If this is flash video file, add it to pending tasks
    if file_extension.lower() in ['flv']:
        data['add_file_to_pending_tasks'] = True

    return
```

</details>

:::note
When you fail a test, you should also update the `issues` list provided in the `data` dictionary.

For example:

```python
data['issues'].append({
    'id':      '<PLUGIN NAME>',
    'message': "File should be ignored because <X>",
})
```

## Worker

Worker plugins define **how the file is processed**. They typically build an `exec_command` for Unmanic to run, or use `PluginChildProcess` to execute Python work while streaming logs/progress to the UI. This family is the core of the pipeline where transcoding, muxing, probing, and other compute-heavy steps happen.

### Process File

#### Details:

This runner configures how a worker processes a file. It is typically used to build or modify the command line for transcoding, inject custom logic, or use the `PluginChildProcess` helper to run Python code with live logs and progress updates. It’s ideal for handling the actual “work” stage of a task.

#### Executed:

Just prior to the execution of the command subprocess within an Unmanic Worker process.

#### Function:

`on_worker_process(data)`

#### Provided data:

- **`task_id`** _[integer]_ - A unique identifier of the task.
- **`worker_log`** _[list]_ - The log lines that are being tailed by the frontend. Can be left empty.
- **`library_id`** _[integer]_ - The ID of the library that the current task is associated with.
- **`exec_command`** _[list or string]_ - A subprocess command that Unmanic should execute. Can be left empty.
- **`command_progress_parser`** _[callable or None]_ - Function, a function that Unmanic can use to parse the STDOUT of the command to collect progress stats. Can be empty.
- **`file_in`** _[string]_ - String, the source file to be processed by the command.
- **`file_out`** _[string]_ - String, the destination that the command should output (may be the same as the file_in if necessary).
- **`original_file_path`** _[string]_ - String, the absolute path to the original file.
- **`repeat`** _[boolean]_ - Boolean, should this runner be executed again once completed with the same variables.

#### Example:

    This class has a number of methods available to it for accessing these settings:

        > get_setting(<key>)            - Fetch a single setting value. Or leave the
                                        key argument empty and return the full dictionary.
        > set_setting(<key>, <value>)   - Set a singe setting value.

    if not settings.get_setting('Execute Command'):
        data['exec_command'] = False



    return
```

</details>

###### Spawning your own child process

Instead of setting `exec_command`, a plugin may use the `PluginChildProcess`
helper to perform complex or Python-only work in a separate process while still
integrating with Unmanic’s log tail and progress reporting.

```python
from unmanic.libs.unplugins.child_process import PluginChildProcess

def child_work(log_queue, prog_queue):
    # Any Python code here
    for i in range(10):
        # emit a UI log line:
        log_queue.put(f"step {i}/10 completed")
        # emit progress 0–100:
        prog_queue.put((i + 1) * 10)
        time.sleep(1)

def on_worker_process(data):
    # Runs child_work in its own process, returns True if exit code==0
    proc = PluginChildProcess(plugin_id="<your_plugin_id>", data=data)
    success = proc.run(child_work)
```

In this mode the `PluginChildProcess` helper:

1. Spawns the child via `multiprocessing.Process`.
2. Registers its PID & start time with the worker’s `default_progress_parser`.
3. Drains `log_queue` → appends to `data["worker_log"]` for UI tail.
4. Drains `prog_queue` → passes to `command_progress_parser(line_text)` to update the progress bar.
5. Automatically unsets the child process PID on exit to reset all tracked subprocess metrics
   in the Unmanic Worker (CPU, memory, progress, etc.).

This approach is useful when you need more control than an external command, or when your
plugin logic is entirely in Python but you still want progress feedback and log visibility
in the Unmanic frontend.

## Post-processor

Post-processor plugins handle **what happens after processing**: moving/copying outputs, deciding whether to remove the source, and reacting to final success/failure. They’re perfect for **finalization and notifications**—publishing results, cleaning up, or triggering follow-up workflows once outcomes are known.

### File movement

#### Details:

This runner is designed for controlling how completed cache files are moved or copied to their final destinations. It can be used to add extra copies, override default moves, or adjust cleanup behavior when handling finished outputs.

#### Executed:

Just prior to file copy operation from cached output file to source file's directory.

#### Function:

`on_postprocessor_file_movement(data)`

#### Provided data:

- **`library_id`** _[integer]_ - The ID of the library that the current task is associated with.
- **`source_data`** _[dictionary]_ - Information about the source file for the task.
- **`remove_source_file`** _[boolean]_ - If true, tells Unmanic to remove the original source file after all copy operations are complete. (default: 'True' if file name has changed)
- **`copy_file`** _[boolean]_ - If true, tells Unmanic to run a copy operation with the returned data variables. (default: 'False')
- **`file_in`** _[string]_ - The converted cache file to be copied by the postprocessor.
- **`file_out`** _[string]_ - The destination file that the file will be copied to.
- **`run_default_file_copy`** _[boolean]_ - If true, tells Unmanic to run the default post-process file movement. (default: 'True')

#### Example:

### Task Result

#### Details:

This runner fires once a task has completed and provides the overall success or failure status. It’s useful for sending webhooks, writing to logs or databases, triggering notifications, or performing cleanup actions when tasks succeed or fail.

#### Executed:

Just prior to the task cache directory cleanup.

#### Function:

`on_postprocessor_task_results(data)`

## Events

Events plugins emit structured data at key moments in a task’s lifecycle (queueing, scheduling, worker start/finish, postprocessor start/finish, library scan complete, etc.). They’re ideal for **observability and orchestration**: push webhooks/metrics, mirror state to dashboards, audit task flow, or trigger downstream automations. Events runners don’t change how work is done; they **report** and enable external systems to react in real time.

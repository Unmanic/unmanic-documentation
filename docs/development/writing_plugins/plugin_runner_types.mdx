## Library Management - File test

##### Executed:
After Unmanic carries out tests on a file to determine if it should be added to the task queue. Prior to returning a result of said tests.

##### Function:
`on_library_management_file_test(data)`

##### Provided data:
  - **`path`** *[string]* - String containing the full path to the file being tested.
  - **`issues`** *[list]* - List of currently found issues for not processing the file.
  - **`add_file_to_pending_tasks`** *[boolean]* - Boolean, is the file currently marked to be added to the queue for processing.

##### Example:

<details>
<summary>plugin.py</summary>

For an up-to-date example, see the [Example Plugins Repo](https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/blob/examples/source/custom_ffmpeg_process/plugin.py)

```python
import os


def on_library_management_file_test(data):
    """
    Runner function - enables additional actions during the library management file tests.
    The 'data' object argument includes:
        path                            - String containing the full path to the file being tested.
        issues                          - List of currently found issues for not processing the file.
        add_file_to_pending_tasks       - Boolean, is the file currently marked to be added to the queue for processing.
    :param data:
    :return:
    """

    # Get the file extension
    file_extension = os.path.splitext(data.get('path'))[-1][1:]

    # Ensure the file's extension is lowercase
    file_extension = file_extension.lower()

    # If this is flash video file, add it to pending tasks
    if file_extension.lower() in ['flv']:
        data['add_file_to_pending_tasks'] = True

    return
```
</details>


##### Details:

This Plugin runner should be used when you wish to create custom actions or tests to be carried
out on a file during the file test triggered by either the Library scan or the Library event watcher.

When you fail a test, you should also update the `issues` list provided in the `data` dictionary.

For example:
```python
data['issues'].append({
    'id':      '<PLUGIN NAME>',
    'message': "File should be ignored because <X>",
})
```

title: Introduction to Writing Plugins
id: introduction

Writing Plugins for Unmanic should be easy. 

All that is required to get started is a basic knowledge of writing
Python scripts.


## Directory Structure

The basic directory structure of a Plugin should be:

```sh
my_new_plugin
├── changelog.md
├── description.md
├── info.json
├── lib
├── package.json
├── plugin.py
├── requirements.txt
└── static
```


---
### File: `changelog.md`

This file should be used to record changes made to the Plugin.


---
### File: `description.json` *(optional)*

This file can be used to extend the description provided within the *info.json* file.


---
### File: `info.json`

A JSON file containing the metadata of your Plugin.
This JSON file should contain the following data:

  - **`author`** - Your name.
  - **`compatibility`** - A list of Unmanic Plugin Handler versions that this Plugin is compatible with (see table below).
  - **`description`** - A long description of your Plugin detailing what it does. To include line-breaks, insert a `\n`.
  - **`icon`** - A URI to an image. If no icon is provided, the default Plugin icon will be used in the WebUI.
  - **`id`** - A string identifier for your Plugin. Should only contain lowercase `a-z` or `_` characters.
  - **`name`** - A very short name for your Plugin.
  - **`platform`** - Platform compatibility of this plugin. Can be any combination of ["all", "linux", "windows", "mac"].
  - **`priorities`** - A dictionary of the initial priority that this Plugin's runners within the Plugin flow.
  - **`tags`** - A comma separated list able to be used as keywords when searching for Plugins.
  - **`version`** - The version of your Plugin.

##### Example:
```json
{
    "author": "Josh.5",
    "compatibility": [
        1,
        2
    ],
    "description": "Specify a language tag for Unmanic to try and put as 1st subtitle track.",
    "icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Josh5/unmanic.plugin.reorder_subtitle_streams_by_language/master/icon.png",
    "id": "reorder_subtitle_streams_by_language",
    "name": "Re-order subtitle streams by language",
    "platform": [
        "all"
    ],
    "priorities": {
        "on_library_management_file_test": 99,
        "on_worker_process": 2
    },
    "tags": "subtitle,ffmpeg,library file test",
    "version": "1.0.4"
}
```

##### Plugin handler compatibility:

| Plugin handler | Unmanic versions |
|----------------|------------------|
| v1             | v0.1.0 - v0.1.4  |
| v2             | v0.2.0 - current |


---
### Directory: `lib` *(optional)*

Location of any additional Python modules imported by this plugin. 
Use this directory if you are including files from another project on GitHub, etc.


---
### File: `package.json` *(optional)*

This file will be read during the plugin build in GitHub. Any nodeJS packages listed will be installed and packaged with the plugin.

Python modules will be installed to `{plugin root}/node_modules`.


---
### File: `plugin.py`

The main Pugin Python module.

This file will be imported and it's functions called by the main Unmanic process.


---
### File: `requirements.txt` *(optional)*

This file will be read during the plugin build in GitHub. Any Python modules listed will be installed and packaged with the plugin.

Python modules will be installed to `{plugin root}/site-packages`.


---
### Directory: `static` *(optional)*

Location of any static assets to be served via the webserver.

Assets located in this directory will be available via the webserver at `/unmanic/panel/{plugin ID}/static/(.*)`.


## Plugin Module

The `plugin.py` file is a stand-alone Python module. From this module you may import other
modules as you see fit. There is no limitation on what may be executed within the 
[**runner**](#runners)
of your Plugin.


---
#### Runners

The Plugin module is made up of defined **runner** functions. A Plugin may include multiple
runner functions such that it is executed at multiple stages of the library optimisation process.

A **data** parameter is provided to the runner functions. This data parameter is a dictionary
object of information pertaining to that stage of the library optimisation process.
This data object's schema that is provided to a plugin runner should still exist once the plugin runner function has completed execution.
During the function, that data may be manipulated as you see fit. 
A plugin runner may fail if data is removed from that data dictionary.

Plugins should be tested with the [**Plugin Manager CLI**](/docs/development/plugin_manager_cli) before publishing changes to ensure
that the returned data matches the required schema for all included runner functions.


##### Example:
```python
def on_worker_process(data):
    ...
    return
```

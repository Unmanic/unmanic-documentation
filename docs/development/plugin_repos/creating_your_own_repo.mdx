If you wish to create your own custom repository, follow these steps.

Feel free to deviate and create a repo your own way.
Following these steps will provide you with a repo that is able to:
- Automatically build plugins
- Check that plugins are compatible for PRs to the official repo
- Provide you with the ability to easily create PRs by following [the next guide](./creating_a_pull_request)

## Instructions:

### Fork the GitHub repo

Start by logging into your github account and navigating the browser to this URL:

https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins

Select the **Fork** button in the top right corner.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-fork-git-repo.png').default} />


Ensure that the repository is forked into your account.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-confirm-fork-git-repo.png').default} />

---


### Cleanup branches

You need to rename the default branch to *master* or *main* on your GitHub Fork. If you don't do this, then the GitHub actions will not publish the plugins.

To do this, open your GitHub fork in a browser and navigate to the branches screen.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-show-branches-git-repo-fork.png').default} />

Select the **Rename Branch** button.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-show-branches-git-repo-fork-rename-examples.png').default} />

Rename the to either **master** or **main**. Select the *Master* branch. Then click **Update**.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-rename-branch-git-repo-fork.png').default} />

Click the green "**Rename Branch.**" button.

---


### Clone your fork

Clone the forked repository from your GitHub profile.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-clone-git-repo-fork.png').default} />

Once you have cloned the repo, change directory to where you cloned it.

```
cd unmanic-plugins
```

---


### Adding Plugin source to repo

All Plugin source files are added under the `source` directory.
These should be added under a directory named the same as the Plugin ID.

Add the files to your source directory and commit.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-commit-plugin-to-git-repo-fork.png').default} />

---


### Enable GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are not enabled by default on new repos. We must first enable it.

The Actions in this repository are managed by the file `.github/workflows/plugin-checker.yml`.

Without enabling these GitHub Actions, your repository will not build when you push to the *master* branch.

<img className={"screenshot"} src={require('/img/unmanic-plugins-enable-github-actions-git-repo-fork.png').default} />

Now that this is done, whenever you commit something on the *master* branch and push back to GitHub, it will automatically build
your repository into the *repo* branch, so long as you have configured your [GitHub Token](#configure-a-github-token) above.

---


### Update repo docs

The last step is to update your repository docs so that they reflect your newly created repository.

Two things are required for this...

1. Update README.md file
    By default, if you followed these steps, your README.md file will still be pointing to:
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Unmanic/unmanic-plugins/repo/repo.json`

    Open the `README.md` file and modify it accordingly.

    For example, in the above URL, replace "*Unmanic/unmanic-plugins*" with "*JaneDoe/unmanic-plugins*".

2. Create config file
    You also need to create a `config.json` file inside the root directory of your repo on the *master* branch.
    In this config.json file, add the following:

    ```
    {
        "id": "repository.YOUR_NAME_NO_SPACES",
        "name": "THE NAME OF YOUR REPO",
        "icon": ""
    }
    ```

Once you have done this, commit the change and push it to the *master* branch.

You are now all set to start using your own Unmanic Plugin Repository.
You can do this by [Adding a Custom Repository](/docs/configuration/plugins/adding_a_custom_plugin_repo) in Unmanic's web interface.

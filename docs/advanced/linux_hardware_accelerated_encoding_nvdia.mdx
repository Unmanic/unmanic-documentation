## Overview

Unmanic itself does not require hardware acceleration, but some plugins can take advantage of NVIDIA NVDEC/NVENC for faster video decoding and encoding.

For example, the Transcode Videos plugin can use NVENC/NVDEC when an NVIDIA GPU is present and correctly configured.

## 1) Check GPU support

You can find an official list of NVIDIA graphics cards and their supported codecs [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-and-decode-gpu-support-matrix-new).

Check that your GPU is listed and is capable of doing what you want it to.

## 2) Install the NVIDIA driver

Ensure you have installed the NVIDIA drivers.

You can download the latest NVIDIA GPU driver from [here](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/187162/en-us).

:::note
The minimum required NVIDIA driver version is 418.30 for this to work in Linux.

:::tip
It is recommended to also patch drivers by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch). This project removes the restriction on maximum simultaneous NVENC video encoding sessions imposed by NVIDIA on consumer-grade GPUs.

## 3) Install FFmpeg with NVENC support

Install FFmpeg for your operating system.

It is recommended to use the [Jellyfin FFmpeg builds](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/advanced/manual#ffmpeg-installation), however any recent release of FFmpeg will work fine.

To ensure your FFmpeg installation is capable of running the NVENC encoders, run this command:

```
for i in encoders decoders filters; do echo $i:; ffmpeg -hide_banner -${i} | egrep -i "npp|cuvid|nvenc|cuda|nvdec"; done
```

You should see a list of available encoders and decoders.

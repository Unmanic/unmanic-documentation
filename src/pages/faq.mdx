# Frequently Asked Questions

## I sponsored Unmanic on Patreon. Why am I still not seeing supporter status in the app?

After you become a supporter on Patreon, there are a few steps behind the scenes before your Unmanic account is marked as a current supporter. Patreon needs to confirm the pledge, then Unmanic periodically checks Patreon and matches that pledge to your Unmanic account. Because parts of this happen on a schedule, it can take a short while for the status to sync.

Try this troubleshooting flow:

1. Visit `https://api.unmanic.app/support-auth-api/link` and log in.
2. Open the avatar dropdown to check your supporter status.
3. If it has not updated yet, wait about 15 minutes, then log out and log back in to refresh the link.
4. Restarting your container is not usually required, but you can do so after you have completed the steps above.

If your status still has not updated after trying the steps above, message `Josh.5` on [Discord](https://unmanic.app/discord) with your Unmanic account email and Patreon email, and it will be resolved within 24 hours.

## How do I report bugs or request features?

Please report issues in the most relevant repository so they reach the right maintainers.

- Plugin bugs should be filed against the source repo for that plugin (the plugin info usually links to it). For example, the Transcode Video Files plugin is here: https://github.com/Unmanic/plugin.video_transcoder/
- Core Unmanic app bugs: https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic
- Frontend and UI issues: https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-frontend
- Documentation issues: https://github.com/Unmanic/unmanic-documentation

## Where should I start if I want to develop plugins?

Start with the [plugin development overview](/docs/development/developing_plugins), then follow the writing plugins guides.

If you want a ready-to-run helper for building plugins with AI agents (or if you have limited coding experience), check out the plugin builder project: https://github.com/Unmanic/tool.plugin-builder

It includes:

- A docker-compose environment for plugin creation and testing
- Helper scripts to clone or update upstream repos
- Targeted instructions for your LLM agent of choice to reference
